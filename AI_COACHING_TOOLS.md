# AI Coaching Tools for Team-Area Relationship Management

## Vision: AI-Guided Configuration Assistant

Instead of running scripts, the AI acts as an intelligent coach that:
1. Analyzes current state
2. Makes smart suggestions
3. Guides users through manual updates
4. Validates changes
5. Tracks progress

## MCP Tools for AI Coaching

### 1. **analyze_team_area_gaps**
```typescript
{
  name: 'analyze_team_area_gaps',
  description: 'Identify teams without areas and areas without teams, with suggestions',
  parameters: {
    project: string,
    includeConfidence?: boolean
  },
  returns: {
    unmappedTeams: [{
      teamName: string,
      suggestedAreas: [{
        areaPath: string,
        confidence: number,
        reasoning: string
      }]
    }],
    orphanedAreas: [{
      areaPath: string,
      suggestedTeams: string[],
      workItemCount: number
    }],
    recommendations: string[]
  }
}
```

**AI Usage Example:**
```
AI: "I've analyzed your Azure DevOps setup. Here's what I found:

📊 Team-Area Mapping Analysis:
- 7 teams have EXACT name matches with areas (100% confidence)
- 15 teams have pattern matches (80-95% confidence)
- 1000+ work items lack area assignments

Would you like me to guide you through fixing these, starting with the highest confidence matches?"
```

### 2. **suggest_next_mapping**
```typescript
{
  name: 'suggest_next_mapping',
  description: 'Get the next recommended team-area mapping to configure',
  parameters: {
    project: string,
    skipTeams?: string[],  // Teams already configured
    strategy?: 'highest_confidence' | 'most_impact' | 'alphabetical'
  },
  returns: {
    team: string,
    suggestedArea: string,
    confidence: number,
    reasoning: string,
    impact: {
      workItemsAffected: number,
      usersAffected: number
    },
    instructions: string[]  // Step-by-step Azure DevOps UI instructions
  }
}
```

**AI Coaching Example:**
```
AI: "Let's start with your highest confidence match:

🎯 Team: 'Administration'
📁 Suggested Area: 'Fidem\Administration'
✅ Confidence: 100% (exact name match)
📊 Impact: This will organize 45 work items for 3 team members

To configure this in Azure DevOps:
1. Navigate to Project Settings > Team Configuration
2. Select 'Administration' team
3. Click 'Areas' tab
4. Click '+ Select area(s)'
5. Choose 'Fidem\Administration'
6. Check 'Include sub-areas' if you want child areas included
7. Click 'Save'

Should I guide you through the next one after you complete this?"
```

### 3. **validate_mapping**
```typescript
{
  name: 'validate_mapping',
  description: 'Check if a team-area mapping was successfully applied',
  parameters: {
    teamName: string,
    expectedArea: string,
    project: string
  },
  returns: {
    isConfigured: boolean,
    actualAreas: string[],
    issues: string[],
    suggestions: string[]
  }
}
```

**AI Validation Example:**
```
AI: "Let me check if the 'Administration' team was configured correctly...

✅ Success! The 'Administration' team is now managing:
- Fidem\Administration (including 2 sub-areas)

This affects:
- 45 work items now properly assigned
- 3 team members can see their work

Ready for the next team? I suggest 'Services' (100% confidence match)."
```

### 4. **coach_work_item_cleanup**
```typescript
{
  name: 'coach_work_item_cleanup',
  description: 'Guide user through fixing unassigned work items',
  parameters: {
    project: string,
    batchSize?: number,  // How many to review at once
    filterBy?: {
      assignedTo?: string,
      workItemType?: string,
      titlePattern?: string
    }
  },
  returns: {
    batch: [{
      workItemId: number,
      title: string,
      currentArea: string,
      suggestedArea: string,
      confidence: number,
      reasoning: string
    }],
    totalRemaining: number,
    progressPercentage: number
  }
}
```

**AI Coaching Example:**
```
AI: "Now let's clean up those 1000+ unassigned work items. I'll guide you through them in small batches.

📋 Batch 1 of 50 (5 items):

1. Work Item #1234: "Update Zinnia API endpoints"
   💡 Suggested Area: Fidem\Zinnia
   🎯 Confidence: 95% (title contains 'Zinnia')
   
2. Work Item #1235: "HRIS integration bug"
   💡 Suggested Area: Fidem\HRIS  
   🎯 Confidence: 98% (title contains 'HRIS')

Would you like to:
A) Apply these suggestions
B) Review each one individually
C) Skip to next batch
D) Filter by specific criteria"
```

### 5. **generate_progress_report**
```typescript
{
  name: 'generate_progress_report',
  description: 'Show configuration progress and remaining work',
  parameters: {
    project: string,
    includeDetails?: boolean
  },
  returns: {
    teamsConfigured: number,
    teamsTotal: number,
    workItemsAssigned: number,
    workItemsUnassigned: number,
    completionPercentage: number,
    nextSteps: string[],
    estimatedTimeRemaining: string
  }
}
```

**AI Progress Tracking:**
```
AI: "Great progress! Here's your configuration status:

📊 Configuration Progress:
✅ Teams Configured: 12/22 (54%)
✅ Work Items Assigned: 750/1750 (43%)

⏱️ Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes

🎯 Next Priority Actions:
1. Configure 'Zinnia - Dev' team (affects 125 work items)
2. Configure 'Integration Project - Dev' team (affects 89 work items)
3. Review 250 unassigned bugs for area assignment

You're doing great! At this pace, you'll have everything organized today."
```

### 6. **explain_impact**
```typescript
{
  name: 'explain_impact',
  description: 'Explain the analytics impact of completing configurations',
  parameters: {
    project: string,
    simulateCompletion?: boolean
  },
  returns: {
    currentCapabilities: string[],
    blockedCapabilities: string[],
    afterCompletionCapabilities: string[],
    examples: [{
      reportType: string,
      currentState: string,
      afterState: string
    }]
  }
}
```

**AI Impact Explanation:**
```
AI: "Let me show you what analytics you'll unlock by completing these configurations:

🔒 Currently Blocked:
- Team velocity tracking (no team-work item associations)
- Sprint burndown charts (teams not linked to work)
- Team performance comparisons (inconsistent data)

🔓 After Configuration:
- Full team velocity metrics
- Accurate sprint analytics  
- Team workload balancing reports
- Predictive delivery dates

Example: Your 'Zinnia - Dev' team currently shows 0 work items. After configuration, you'll see their actual 125 items and can track their 15 items/sprint velocity."
```

## Interactive Coaching Session Example

       Where would you like to start?"
       
  User: "Quick wins"
  
  AI: "Perfect! Let's knock out those exact matches. First up:
       
       Team: 'Administration' → Area: 'Fidem\Administration'
       
       Please open Azure DevOps and navigate to:
       Project Settings > Teams > Administration > Areas
       
       Let me know when you're there and I'll guide you through the next steps."
